    </div>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The German Waiter waxeth fat; he grows exceeding
            proud;</p>

            <p>He is a shade more kicksome than can fairly be
            allowed.</p>

            <p>The British Press goes out to dine&mdash;the Teuton,
            they relate,</p>

            <p>Throws down his napkin like a gage, and swears he
            will not wait.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Now there are many proverbs&mdash;some are good and
            some are not&mdash;</p>

            <p>But the Teuton was misled who cried, "Strike while
            the <i>entrée</i>'s hot!"</p>

            <p>Like readers with no book-marks, all the rebels lost
            their place,</p>

            <p>And vanished out of Chelsea in their dress-suits and
            disgrace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And I'm told that there were murmurings and curses
            deep and low</p>

            <p>In darksome public-houses in the road of
            Pimlico,</p>

            <p>And a general impression that it was not safe to
            cross</p>

            <p>The temper of that caterer, Mr. MACKENZIE ROSS.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>O Waiter, German Waiter! there are many other
            lands</p>

            <p>Where you can take your creaking boots and eke your
            dirty hands;</p>

            <p>And we think you'll have discovered, ere you reach
            your next address,</p>

            <p>That in England German Waiters aren't the Censors of
            the Press.</p>

    <h2>MARLOWE AT CANTERBURY.</h2>

    <p>"Keep up the Christopher!" a recommendation adapted <i>urbi
    et orbi</i> which, quoting <i>Mr. Puff</i>, our HENRY when
    speaking at Canterbury ought to have given after the unveiling
    of KIT MARLOWE's statue. We hope that the unveiling address
    will not prove unavailing, and that the necessary funds may
    soon be forthcoming for the completion of the work. For the
    present all that has been effected by the ceremony is to have
    given the <i>Times</i> and <i>Telegraph</i> opportunities for
    interesting leading articles at a very dull season when
    material is scarce; also it has given the author of <i>Tom
    Cobb</i> and other remarkable plays a chance of writing to the
    <i>Times</i>; and finally it has broken in upon the well-earned
    holiday of the indefatigable and good-natured HENRY. But there
    was one question not put by our HENRY. It ought to have arisen
    out of the record of MARLOWE's interment, but didn't. "The
    burial register of St. Nicholas, Deptford," said the
    <i>Times</i> of September 16, "contains the entry, 'CHRISTOPHER
    MARLOWE, slain by FRANCIS ARCHER, June 1, 1593.'" The entry
    maybe taken as veracious, although made by "a clerk of St.
    Nicholas." [MARLOWE was a dramatist; was ARCHER a dramatic
    critic?]</p>

            Thug,</p>

    <p>ANOTHER STRIKE THREATENED.&mdash;The advent of the brother
    of the reigning King of SIAM threatens to cause embarrassment
    in some English houses where HIS HIGHNESS might expect to be
    received. JEAMES has positively declined to throw open a door
    and announce, "Prince DAMRONG!" "Such langwidge," he says, "is
    unbecoming and beneath Me&mdash;leastways unless it is
    remembered in the wages."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>WHY SHOULD MERIT WAIT?</h2>

    <p>We have reason to believe that Sir HENRY EDWARDS, whose
    stone image adorns a thoroughfare in Weymouth, will not long be
    left in sole possession of the honour of having a monument
    dedicated to him in his lifetime. In view of an interesting
    event pending in his family, it is proposed that a statue shall
    be erected to Sir SAMUEL WILSON, M.P., in the grounds at
    Hughenden. The project has so far advanced that the inscription
    has been drafted, and we are pleased to be able to quote
    it:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Dear Miss DOLLIE RADFORD," writes the Assistant-Reader, "I
    trust I am right in the feminine and unconjugal prefix; but, be
    that as it may, I wish simply to tell you that, at the
    instigation of a lettered friend, I have spent a few moments
    very wisely in reading your thin little book of verse, <i>A
    Light Load</i>. (ELKIN MATHEWS.) I feel now as if I had been
    gently drifting down a smooth broad river under the moonlight,
    when all nature is quiet. I don't quite know why I feel like
    that, but I fancy it must be on account of some serene and
    peaceful quality in your poems. Here, then, there are
    sixty-four little pages of restfulness for those whose minds
    are troubled. You don't plunge into the deep of metaphysics and
    churn it into a foam, but you perch on your little bough and
    pipe sweetly of gorse and heather and wide meadows and
    brightly-flashing insects; you sing softly as when, in your own
    words&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"&mdash;gently this evening the ripples break</p>

            <p class="i2">On the pebbles beneath the trees,</p>

            <p>With a music as low as the full leaves make,</p>

            sea-breeze."</p>

    <p>One of my "Co." says he always reads anything that comes in
    his way bearing the trade-mark BLACKWOOD. His faith has been
    justified on carrying off with him on a quiet holiday, <i>His
    Cousin Adair</i>, by GORDON ROY. The book has all the
    requisites of a good novel, including the perhaps rarest one of
    literary style. <i>Cousin Adair</i> is well worth knowing, and
    her character is skilfully portrayed. As a foil against this
    high-minded, pure-souled unselfish girl, there are sketched in
    two or three of the sort of people, men and women, more
    frequently met with in this wicked world. But <i>Cousin
    Adair</i> is good enough to leaven the lump. GORDON ROY is
    evidently a <i>nom de plume</i> that might belong to man or
    woman. My "Co." is inclined to think, from certain subtle
    touches, that he has been entertained through three volumes by
    a lady.</p>

    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. VIII.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A Bridge over the Pegnitz, at Nuremberg.
        Time, afternoon. The shadows of the old gabled and
        balconied houses are thrown sharply on the reddish-yellow
        water. Above the steep speckled roofs, the spires of St.
        Lorenz glitter against the blue sky.</i> CULCHARD <i>is
        leaning listlessly upon the parapet of the bridge</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>to himself</i>). How mediæval it all is,
    and how infinitely restful! (<i>He yawns</i>.) What a blessed
    relief to be without that fellow PODBURY! He's very careful to
    keep out of my way&mdash;I've scarcely seen him since I've been
    here. He must find it dreadfully dull. (<i>He sighs</i>.) I
    ought to find material for a colour-sonnet here, with these
    subdued grey tones, those dull coppery-greens, and the glowing
    reds of the conical caps of those towers. I
    <i>ought</i>&mdash;but I don't. I fancy that half-engagement to
    MAUD TROTTER must have, scared away the Muse. I wonder if
    PODBURY has really gone yet? (<i>Here a thump on the back
    disposes of any doubt as to this</i>.) Er&mdash;so you're still
    at Nuremberg? [Awkwardly.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/146.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/146.png"
             alt="'Er--I have brought you the philosophical work I mentioned.'" />
        </a>"Er&mdash;I have brought you the philosophical work I
        mentioned."
    </div>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>cheerfully</i>). Rather! Regular ripping
    old place this&mdash;suits me down to the ground. And how are
    <i>you</i> getting on?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Perfectly, thanks. My mind is
    being&mdash;er&mdash;stimulated here in the direction most
    congenial to it.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So's mine. By the way, have you got a
    book&mdash;don't mean a novel, but a regular improving
    book&mdash;the stodgier the better&mdash;to lend a fellow?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, I brought an <i>Epitome of Herbert
    Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy</i> away with me to dip into
    occasionally. It seems a very able summary, and you are welcome
    to it, if it's of any use to you.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> SPENCER, eh?&mdash;he's a stiff kind of old
    bird, ain't he? He'll do me to-rights, thanks.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It strikes me, PODBURY, that you must find the
    time rather long, to want a book of that kind. If you wish to
    resume our&mdash;ah&mdash;original relations, I am quite ready
    to overlook what I am sure was only a phase of not unnatural
    disappointment.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>cheerily</i>). Oh, <i>that's</i> all right,
    old fellow. I've got over all that business. (<i>He colours
    slightly</i>.) How soon did you think of moving on?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>briskly</i>). As soon as you please. We
    might start for Constance to-morrow, if you like.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>hesitating</i>) Well, you see, it's just
    this: there's a fellow staying at my hotel&mdash;PRENDERGAST,
    his name is&mdash;rattling good sort&mdash;and I've rather
    chummed up with him, and&mdash;and he's travelling with a
    relation of his, and&mdash;well, the fact is, they rather made
    a point of my going on to Constance with <i>them</i>, don't you
    see? But I daresay we could work it so as to go on all
    together. I'll see what they say about it.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>stiffly</i>). I'm exceedingly
    obliged&mdash;but so large a party is scarcely&mdash;however,
    I'll let you know whether I can join you or not this evening.
    Are you&mdash;er&mdash;going anywhere in particular just
    now?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Well, yes. I've got to meet PRENDERGAST at the
    <i>Café Noris</i>. We're going to beat up some stables, and see
    if we can't hire a couple of gees for an hour or two before
    dinner. Do you feel inclined for a tittup?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Thanks, but I am no equestrian. (<i>To
    himself, after</i> PODBURY's <i>departure</i>.) He seems to
    manage well enough without me. And yet I do think my society
    would be more good for him than&mdash;. Why did he want to
    borrow that book, though? Can my influence after all&mdash;
    (<i>He walks on thoughtfully, till he finds himself before an
    optician's window in which a mechanical monkey is looking
    through a miniature telescope; the monkey suddenly turns its
    head and gibbers at him. This familiarity depresses him, and he
    moves away, feeling lonelier than ever</i>.)</p>

    <h4><i>On the Terrace of the Burg. Half an hour later.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>on a seat commanding a panorama of roofs,
    gables, turrets, and spires</i>). Now this is a thing that can
    only be properly enjoyed when one is by oneself. The mere
    presence of PODBURY&mdash;well, thank goodness, he's found more
    congenial company. (<i>He sighs</i>.) That looks, like an
    English girl sketching on the next seat. Rather a fine profile,
    so regular&mdash;general air of repose about her. Singular, now
    I think of it, how little repose there is about MAUD. (The
    Young Lady <i>rises and walks to the parapet</i>.) Dear me, she
    has left her india-rubber behind her. I really think I
    ought&mdash; (<i>He rescues the india-rubber, which he restores
    to the owner</i>.) Am I mistaken in supposing that this piece
    of india-rubber is your property?</p>

    <p><i>The Y.L.</i> (<i>in musically precise tones</i>). Your
    supposition is perfectly correct. I was under the impression
    that it would be safe where it was for a few moments; but I am
    obliged to you, nevertheless. I find india-rubber quite
    indispensable in sketching.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I can quite understand that. I&mdash;I mean
    that it reduces the&mdash;er&mdash;paralysing sense of
    irrevocability.</p>

    <p><i>The Y.L.</i> You express my own meaning exactly.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[CULCHARD, <i>not being quite sure of his own, is
        proportionately pleased.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You nave chosen an inspiring scene, rich with
    historical interest.</p>

    <p><i>The Y.L.</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). Yes, indeed. What
    names rise to one's mind instinctively MELANCHTHON, JOHN HUSS,
    KRAFT, and PETER VISCHER, and DÜRER, and WOHLGEMUT, and
    MAXIMILIAN THE FIRST, and LOUIS OF BAVARIA!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>who has read up the local history, and
    does not intend to be beaten at this game</i>). Precisely. And
    the imperious MARGRAVE OF BRANDENBURG, and WALLENSTEIN; and
    GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, and GOETZ VON BERLICHINGEN. One can almost
    see their&mdash;er&mdash;picturesque personalities still
    haunting the narrow streets as we look down.</p>

    <p><i>The Y.L.</i> I find it impossible to distinguish even the
    streets from here, I confess, but you probably see with the
    imagination of an artist. <i>Are</i> you one by any chance?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Only in words; that is, I record my
    impressions in a poetic form. A perfect sonnet may render a
    scene, a mood, a passing thought, more indelibly than the most
    finished sketch; may it not?</p>

    <p><i>The Y.L.</i> That is quite true; indeed, I occasionally
    relieve my feelings by the composition of Greek or Latin
    verses, which I find, on the whole, better adapted to express
    the subtler emotions. Don't you agree with me there?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>who has done no Greek or Latin verse since
    he left school</i>). Doubtless. But I am hindering your
    sketch?</p>

    <p><i>The Y.L.</i> No, I was merely saturating my mind with the
    general effect. I shall not really begin my sketch till
    to-morrow. I am going now. I hope the genius of the place will
    inspire you.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Thank you. I trust it will&mdash;er&mdash;have
    that effect. (<i>To himself, after the Young Lady has left the
    terrace</i>.) Now, that's a very superior girl&mdash;she has
    intellect, style, culture&mdash;everything the ideal woman
    <i>should</i> have. I wonder, now, whether, if I had met her
    before&mdash;but such speculations are most unprofitable! How
    clear her eyes looked through her <i>pince-nez</i>! Blue-grey,
    like Athene's own. If I'd been with PODBURY, I should never
    have had this talk. The sight of him would have repelled her at

    better go his own way with his new friends. I shall spend most

    <p>A NOTE AND QUERY.&mdash;At the enthronement of Dr. MACLAGAN
    as Archbishop of York "the band of the First Royal Dragoons,"
    says the <i>Daily Graphic</i>, "played an appropriate march."
    That the band of the Royal Dragoons should symbolically and
    cymballically represent the Church Militant is right enough;
    but what is "a march appropriate" to an Archbishop? One of
    BISHOP's glees would have been more suitable to the occasion.
    Henceforth Dr. MACLAGAN can say, if he likes, "I'<i>m
    Arch</i>-bishop of Canterbury!"</p>

    <h2>A MUSICAL SUGGESTION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Certainly New and Original.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Why doesn't one of our talented composers&mdash;Sir ARTHUR,
    or Mr. MACKENZIE, or Mr. STANFORD, or Mr. EDWARD
    SOLOMON&mdash;write a Cantata, entitled <i>The Weather?</i> The
    subject is thoroughly English, and lends itself so evidently to
    much variety in treatment. The title should be, <i>The Weather:
    a Meteorological Cantata</i>.</p>

    <p>It should commence with a hopeful movement, indicative of
    the views of various people interested in the weather as to
    future probabilities. The sportsman, the agriculturist, the
    holiday-maker, likewise the livery-stable keeper, and the
    umbrella manufacturer would, <i>cum multis aliis</i>, be all
    represented; Songs without Words; the Sailor's Hope; then wind
    instruments; solo violin; the Maiden's Prayer for her
    Sailor-love's Safety, &amp;c. Then "as the arrows" (on the
    <i>Times</i> chart) "fly with the wind," so would the piccolo,
    followed by the trombone, and thus the approach of the storm
    would be indicated. Roll on drum, distant thunder; the storm
    passes off, and we have a beautiful air (the composer's best),
    which delights and reassures us.</p>

    <p>All at once, "disturbances advance from the Atlantic;" grand
    effect, this!</p>

    <p>Sudden Fall of Barometer! (This would be something startling
    on drum and cymbals, with, on 'cello, a broken chord.)
    Momentary relief of a "light and fresh breeze" (hornpipe),
    interrupted by showers from the West and winds from the North;
    then strong wind from East (something Turkish here); light
    breeze from Scotland (Highland Fling); Anticyclonic movement;
    "Depression" on the hautbois; increase of wind; then thunder,
    lightning, rain&mdash;all the elements at it! Grand effect!!
    Crash!!! and ... for <i>finale</i>, calm sea, sun shining,
    joyful chorus, Harvest Home, weddings, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
    &amp;c.</p>

    <p>I've nothing more to say. Surely this outline is sufficient.
    Only if any Composer does make use of this idea, and become
    famous thereby, let him not be ungrateful to the suggester of
    this brilliant notion (copyright), whose name and address may
    be had for the asking at the Fleet Street Office.</p>

             alt="'Karascho!' exclaims Daubinet." /></a>"Karascho!"
             exclaims Daubinet.
    </div>

    <p>DAUBINET, quite recovered from his fatigue, sings "Blass the
    Prince of WAILES" enthusiastically, and at intervals ejaculates
    queer, uncouth words in the Russian tongue. Breakfast with
    Russian tongue. He asks the waiter for "<i>minuoschhah karosh
    caviar</i>." To which the waiter adroitly replies,
    "<i>parfaitement M'sieu</i>" and disappears. Returning ten
    minutes afterwards, the wily attendant makes no further
    allusion to the supposed errand that has taken him out of the
    room.</p>

    <p>Then DAUBINET, remembering that we are literally "here
    to-day and gone to-morrow," says we must visit his friend the
    Vicomte. I cannot catch the Vicomte's name; I manage to do so
    for half an hour at a time, and then it escapes me. As we are
    in this champagney country, I write it down as M. le Vicomte DE
    CHAMPAGNIAC. We are to dine and sleep there. A Night in a
    French Château. "But this is another story."</p>

    <p>On our arrival at the Château de Quelquechose we are right
    royally and heartily received. Delightful evening. <i>Vive la
    Compagnie</i>! Magnificent view from my bedroom. In the clear
    moonlight I can see right away for miles and miles over the
    Champagne valleys. At 6.30 we are in the break, and within an
    hour or so are "All among the barley," as the song used to say,
    which I now apply to "All amongst the Vineyards." Peasants at
    work everywhere: picking and sorting. How they must dislike
    grapes! Of course they are all teetotallers, and no more touch
    a drop of champagne than a grocer eats his own currants, or a
    confectioner his own sweetmeats. I suppose the butcher lives
    exclusively on fish, and his friend, the neighbouring
    fishmonger, is entirely dependent on the butcher for his
    sustenance, except when game is in, and then both deal with the
    gamester or poulterer. There are some traders in necessaries
    who can make a fair deal all round. The only exception to this
    rule, for which, from personal observation, I can vouch, is the
    tobacconist, who is always smoking his own cigars.</p>

    <p>Wonderful this extensive plain of vineyards! and what
    stunted little stumps with leaves round them are all these
    vines! Not in it with our own graceful hops. No hedges or
    ditches to separate one owner's property from another's. To
    each little or big patch of land there is a white headstone
    with initials on it, as if somebody had hurriedly and
    unostentatiously been buried on the spot where he fell, killed
    in the Battle of the Vineyards, by a grape-shot. At first,
    seeing so many of these white headstones with initials on each
    one, I conclude that it is some peculiar French way of marking
    distances or laying out plots, and I find my conclusion is
    utterly erroneous.</p>

    <p>"These white stones," M. VESQUIER. explains, "mark the
    boundaries of different properties." Odd! The plain is cut up
    into little patches, and champagne-growers, like knowing birds,
    have popped down, on "here a bit and there a bit and everywhere
    a bit" from time to time, so that one headstone records the
    fact that "here lies the property of J.M.," and within a few
    feet is another headstone "sacred to the memory of P. and G.,"
    or P. without the G.; then removed but a step or two is a stone
    with a single "A." on it. and a short distance from the road is
    "H."&mdash;poor letter "H" apparently dropped for ever. Here
    lie "M.," and "M. and C.," and several other heroes whose names
    recall many a glorious champagne. And so on, and so on; the
    initials recurring again quite unexpectedly, the plots of
    ground held by the same proprietor being far apart. But, as it
    suddenly occurs to me, if these champagne-growers are all in
    the same plains for twenty miles or more round about, all in
    much the same position, and all the grapes apparently the same,
    why isn't it all the same wine?</p>

    <p>"<i>Karascho!</i>" exclaims DAUBINET, who, under the hot
    rays of the early morning sun, is walking in his shirt-sleeves,
    his coat over his arm, his hat in one hand, and a big sunshade
    in the other, "I will tell you." Then he commences, and except
    for now and then breaking off into Russian expletives, and
    interspersing his discourse with selections from British
    national melodies, his explanation is lucid, and the reasons
    evident. Soil and sun account for everything; the soil being
    varied, and the sun shifty. "<i>Pou ni my? comprenez-vous?</i>"
    he asks.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:65%;">
        <a href="images/148-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="'Da Karascho! All r-r-right!'" /></a>"Da
             Karascho! All r-r-right!"
    </div>

    <p>I do perfectly, at the moment; but subsequently trying to
    explain the phenomena scientifically, I find that I have not
    quite penetrated the mystery <i>au fond</i>. We visit the
    Wine-press, which (<i>Happy Thought!</i>) would be an
    appropriate title for a journal devoted entirely to the
    wine-growing and wine-vending interests.</p>

    <p>"And now," says M. le Vicomte, "we must return to breakfast,
    or the sun will be too strong for us."</p>

    <p>So back we go to our eleven o'clock <i>déjeuner</i> in a
    beautifully cool room, of which repast the sweetest little
    cray-fish, fresh from the river, are by no means the worst part
    of the entertainment. Then coffee, cigars, and lounge. Yes,
    there are some things better managed in France than <i>chez
    nous</i>; and the division of the day between labour and
    refreshment is, in my humble opinion, one of them. In the
    contriving of dainty dishes out of the simplest materials, the
    French seem to hold that everything is good for food in this
    best of all possible worlds, if it be only treated on a wise
    system of variation, permutation, and combination. We discuss
    these subjects of the higher education until arrives the
    inevitable hour of departure. Let us not linger on the
    doorstep. Into the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> trap again. <i>Bon voyage!
       Au revoir!</i> And as passing out of the lodge-gate we get a
       last glimpse of the party waving adieux to us from the upper
       terrace, DAUBINET flourishes his hat, and sings out at the
       top of his voice, "We're leaving thee in sorrow, ANNIE,"
       which is more or less appropriate, perhaps; and then, as the
       last flutter of a pocket-handkerchief is seen, he finishes
       with "And blass the Prince of WAILES!" After which he
       subsides, occasionally breaking the silence to sigh aloud,
       "<i>O Maman!</i>" and thenceforth, for the greater part of
       the journey to Paris, he slumbers in a more or less jumpy
       manner.</p>

    <p><i>At the Grand Hotel, Paris</i>.&mdash;"Aha!" cries M. le
    Baron BLUM,&mdash;always in full Blum at the Grand
    Hotel,&mdash;"At last! arrived!" as if he had expected us for
    several weeks past,&mdash;"How are you? I have your rooms ready
    for you!" He must have seen us driving into the courtyard, and
    settled our numbers there and then, not a minute ago. It's a
    great thing for weary travellers to be welcomed on arrival. No
    matter if they're forgotten again the next moment, and not
    thought of again until the hour of their departure. It is the
    welcome that is everything; it implies so much, and may mean so
    little. But, at the Grand, Paris, <i>Avis aux Messieurs les
    voyageurs,</i> "When in doubt, consult BLUM!" We enjoy a good
    but expensive dinner at the Maison Dorée. For myself, I prefer
    the simple fare at half the price to be found <i>chez Noël</i>,
    or at some other quiet and moderate restaurants that I could
    name. Next morning a brief but welcome breakfast at Amiens, a

    <p>Whenever I forgot to put the matches in my pocket on leaving
    the chambers, I used to buy a box from a boy who stood at the
    street corner, where the 'busses stop. He was a small boy,
    somewhat ragged and occasionally a good deal splashed with mud.
    He was bright and energetic, and he did a very fair trade.
    There was an air of complete independence about him, which one
    does not often find in match-boys. His method of recommending
    his wares was considerably above the average of the peripatetic
    vendor; it suggested a large emporium, plate glass, mahogany
    counters, and gorgeous assistants with fair hair parted in the
    middle:</p>

    <p>"Now off'rin! A unooshally lawge box of wax vestas for one
    penny. Shop early and shop often. Foosees, Sir? Yessir. Part o'
    a bankrupt's stock."</p>

    <p>This was smart of him. By differing a little from the usual
    match-boy manner, he attracted more attention, and grins, and
    coppers.</p>

    <p>One morning I had climbed up to the top of the 'bus and
    taken my seat, when I saw that the boy had followed me.</p>

    <p>"No use," I said; "I don't want any this morning."</p>

    <p>"Well, I ain't sellin' none this mornin', Sir. I'm goin' a
    ride on this 'ere 'buss. My wife's got the carridge hout in the
    Park; so I'm druv to takin' busses&mdash;same as you, Sir." He
    took the seat next to mine, and added seriously, "I expecks as
    you ain't likely to be buyin' no more matches from me."</p>

    <p>"Why, WILLIAM?"</p>

    <p>"My name is REGGERNULD, Sir. Yer see, I'm movin' inter other
    premises, as yer might say. I've give up my stand at yon
    corner." He jerked his thumb in the direction of it.</p>

    <p>"What's that for?"</p>

    <p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;nothin'. Some of 'em think I'm a fool
    for doin' it. The fac' was&mdash;I couldn't quite git on with
    my comp'ny there?"</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"I mean that other boy what come last Toosday, and started
    sellin' pipers at my corner. You don't know 'oo 'e is, p'r'aps,
    nor 'oo I am." I did not know, and I was very willing to get
    the story out of REGINALD.</p>

    <p>"Well, I come o' pretty mod'rately 'spectable folks, I do;
    and I ain't goin' to chum up with no thieves' sons an' as like
    as not thieves theirselves. No thankyer. Them Board Schools is
    a deal too mixed. Thet's 'ow I come to know about thet boy. 'Is
    father 'ad a barrer, thet were what <i>'is</i> father did for a
    livelihood, an' 'is mother were up afore the beaks for poppin'
    shirts what she'd took in to wash. Well, I ain't one to brag,
    but my father were a 'air-dresser's assistant in Pimlico.
    Pretty well up, too, 'e was. The way 'e'd shive yer were
    sutthin' to see. Shivin'? Yer couldn't call it shivin'; it were
    gen'us, thet's what it were. Speccilation rooined 'im. 'E
    stawted a small plice of 'is own, and bust. Then 'e took to the
    turf, and bust agin. Then Mother begun dress-mikin' and there
    weren't no dress-mikin' to be 'ad; so that bust. We was
    unfortnit. Heve'rythin' as we touched bust. But we never run no
    barrers, an' we never was up afore no beaks, and if there
    weren't such a thund'rin' lot of us, I shouldn't be doin' this
    now. Anywye, I respecs myself. So I'm goin' to start a new
    pitch an' chawnce it."</p>

    <p>I inquired where the new pitch was to be.</p>

    <p>"I'm swoppin' with another boy (EDDUDS 'is nime is) up fur
    end o' this street. 'E ain't so perticler as I am. Clerks lives
    there mostly, an' the biz ain't so good as it was in my old
    plice. Them clerks wears top-'ats, an' consequently they
    daren't smoke pipes. They cawn't afford to smoke cigars, and
    cigarettes is off'rin' eyep'ny oices to a stawvin' man. So they
    don't smoke at all, an' don't want no matches. An' I don't
    blime 'em, mind yer. Pussonally, I chews&mdash;but if I smoked
    a pipe I wouldn't do it with one o' them 'ats on. 'Cos why?
    'Cos I believes in a bit o' style. Not that I'm stuck-up as yer
    might say, but I don't see no sense in lettin' myself down. If
    I'd liked I could 'a made it so 'ot fur thet newspiper boy that
    'e'd 'ave 'ad to go. I could 'a mopped up the puddles with 'im
    if I'd wanted. But I wouldn't. I wouldn't conterminate myself
    by so much as 'avin' a word with 'im. I'd sooner
    leave&mdash;even if I lose money on it. My father were one for
    style too, afore 'is shop bust. Thet's 'ow it is, yer see. Some
    goes up, and some goes down. We've come down, but I draws the
    line somewheer fur all thet&mdash;sure's my name's REGGERNALD.
    An' what do you think?"</p>

    <p>I told him that I was rather inclined to think that he was
    an idiot, and tried to show him why he was an idiot. But he
    would not be convinced. Class prejudice was strong within
    'im.</p>

    <p>"Look 'ere," he said, "you may think I'm young to be
    a'visin' o' you, Sir. But jest mark my words&mdash;you cawn' be
    too keerful what comp'ny yer gits familyer with. I gits off
    'ere. All&mdash;right, kinducter, yer needn't stop."</p>

    <h2>THE MODERN CAGLIOSTRO; OR, THE POWER OF THE SPIRITS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Page from a Romance up to Date.</i>)</h4>

    <p>And so PETER, learning that the veteran Alchymist was to be
    seen on the presentation of a small coin of the realm,
    approached the old man's residence. He had heard that the Sage
    had discovered the secret of immortality&mdash;barring
    accidents, he would live for ever.</p>

    <p>"Now that JOSEPHINE is true to me," he murmured, "I have no
    objection to a further century of existence, or even two."</p>

    <p>And he continued his walk. He had never seen so many taverns
    in his life. On every side of him were distilleries,
    public-houses, and beer-shops. He marvelled that a man of so
    many summers should have chosen such a bibulous spot for his
    home.</p>

    <p>"He must be exceedingly eccentric," he thought to himself;
    "however, that is nothing to me. If he can teach me how to live
    continuously, this bag of gold, now mine, shall change
    masters."</p>

    <p>The small coin of the realm was presented, and PETER stood
    face to face with the Sage of the Ages.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" asked the ancient Alchymist, with a
    glistening eye. "What d'ye want with an old man&mdash;a very
    old man?" And the Sage wept.</p>

    <p>"I meant not this," remonstrated PETER, greatly distressed
    at the incident. "I came here merely to crave your aid. I wish
    to live now, for JOSEPHINE is true to me."</p>

    <p>"Who's JOSEPHINE?" asked the Sage, in the same thick voice.
    "Never heard of JOSEPHINE. JOSEPHINE's bore&mdash;swindle! Old
    JOSEPHINE's jolly humbug!"</p>

    <p>"Well, let that pass," said PETER, "I am here to ask you why
    you have lived so long. You are one hundred and twenty-seven
    years old, I think, and yet you are still alive."</p>

    <p>"Why, certainly. But you know all about it. Secret no
    longer. Dr. MORTIMER GRANVILLE has told the <i>Times</i> how
    it's done. Consider it great shame. Takes the bread, so t'
    speak, out of one's mouth." Here the Sage gave a lurch and
    seated himself accidentally on a stuffed alligator. Seeing that
    his host was about to indulge in an untimely nap, PETER thought
    the moment had arrived to urge him to reveal his wonderful
    secret. "I implore you to tell me how you have managed to live
    for so many years when all your contemporaries are gone."</p>

    <p>"Well, sure I don't mind," was the reply. "Won't hurt
    me&mdash;may do you good. Want to know how it's managed?"</p>

    <p>"That I do, indeed," was the earnest answer,</p>

    <p>"Why reason I've lived for more than century and quarter is
    this! I've never been&mdash;mind, never been during all that
    time&mdash;see&mdash;during all that time&mdash;never been
    sober!"</p>

    <p>PETER was astounded.</p>

    <p>"Why, Sir WILFRID LAWSON says&mdash;" he began.</p>

    <p>"Never mind what Sir WILF-LAWSON says, I say if you want,
    keep your health you
    must&mdash;hic&mdash;always&mdash;be&mdash;in&mdash;in&mdash;intoxicavated!
    Now go to public-house. My patients in public-houses
    yonder."</p>

    <p>And, urged by a sense of duty, PETER withdrew; and, joining
    the Sage's cures, found them in various stages of renewed
    health, and increased intoxication.</p>

    <h2>JOURNAL OF A ROLLING STONE.</h2>

    <h3>EIGHTH ENTRY.</h3>

    <p>Since my call to the Bar, have been treating myself to
    rather a long roll abroad. Now, however, the time has come to
    devote myself to the work of the profession, which seems to
    mean studying practical law with some discreet and learned
    Barrister.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/156.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/156.png"
             alt="Dick Fibbins." /></a>Dick Fibbins.
    </div>

    <p>Met a few nights ago, at dinner, a very entertaining fellow.
    Full of legal anecdotes. Told that it was DICK FIBBINS, a
    Barrister, "and rather a rising one." DICK (why not RICHARD?)
    talked about County Courts with condescending tolerance; even
    the High Court Judges seemed (according to his own account) to
    habitually quail before his forensic acumen.</p>

    <p>Mentioned to FIBBINS that I had just been "called," and was
    "thinking of reading in a Barrister's chambers;" and he seemed
    to take the most friendly and generous interest in me at
    once&mdash;asked me, indeed, to call on him any day I liked at
    his chambers in Waste Paper Buildings, which I thought
    extremely kind, as I was a complete stranger.</p>

    <p>Go next day. Clerk, with impressive manner, receives me with
    due regard to his principal's legal standing.
    (<i>Query</i>&mdash;has a <i>rising</i> Barrister any
    standing?) Ushered into large room, surrounded with shelves
    containing, I imagine, the Law Reports from the Flood
    downwards. Just thinking what an excellent "oldest inhabitant"
    METHUSELAH would have made in a "Right of Way" case, when DICK
    FIBBINS rises from the wooden arm-chair on which he has been
    sitting at a table crowded with papers, and bundles tied up in
    dirty red tape, and shakes hands heartily.</p>

    <p>"What's your line of country?" he asks&mdash;"Equity or
    Common Law?"</p>

    <p>I admit that it's Common Law. Have momentary feeling that
    Equity sounds better, Why <i>Common</i> Law?</p>

    <p>"Quite right," he says, encouragingly; "much the best
    branch. <i>I</i> am a Common-Law man too." Refers to it as if
    it were a moral virtue on his&mdash;and my&mdash;part to have
    avoided Equity. Wonder if Equity men talk in this way about
    "Common" Lawyers? If so, oughtn't there to be more <i>esprit de
    corps</i> in the Profession?</p>

    <p>"Been before old PROSER, Queen's Bench Division, to-day," he
    proceeds. "Do you ever sit in Court?"</p>

    <p>I reluctantly confess that I have not made an habitual point
    of doing so.</p>

    <p>"Ah," he says, finding that I can't contradict him as to
    what did really happen in old PROSER's Court to-day; "you
    <i>should</i> have been there just now. Had BLOWHARD, the great
    Q.C., opposed to me. But, bless you, he couldn't do anything to
    speak of against my arguments. PROSER really hardly would
    listen to him once or twice. Made BLOWHARD quite lose his
    temper, I assure you."</p>

    <p>"So he lost his case, too, I suppose?" I remark,
    humorously.</p>

    <p>"Um," replies FIBBINS, sinking into despondency, "not
    exactly. PROSER didn't quite like to decide <i>against</i>
    BLOWHARD, you know; so he&mdash;so he&mdash;er&mdash;decided
    <i>for</i> him, in fact. Of course we appeal. It won't," goes
    on FIBBINS, more cheerfully, "do BLOWHARD's clients a bit of
    good. Only run their bill up. I'm safe to win before the Court
    of Appeal. Lord Justice GRILL a first-rate lawyer&mdash;sure to
    reverse old PROSER. I can," he ends with conscious pride,
    "twist GRILL round my finger, so to speak."</p>

    <p>The idea of twisting a Lord Justice round one's finger
    impresses me still more with DICK FIBBINS's legal genius. How
    lucky I am to have made his acquaintance! Feel impelled to ask,
    as I do rather nervously, not knowing if a bitter
    disappointment does not await me.</p>

    <p>"Do you&mdash;er&mdash;take legal pupils ever?"</p>

    <p>I feel that I've put it in a way that sounds like asking him
    if he indulges in drink. But FIBBINS evidently not offended. He
    answers briskly, with engaging candour.</p>

    <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, though I've often been asked
    to&mdash;quite pestered about it, in fact&mdash;I've never done
    so hitherto. The Solicitors don't like it quite&mdash;makes 'em
    think one is wasting the time which ought to be given to their
    briefs on one's own pups&mdash;I mean pupils."</p>

    <p>Perhaps, after all, FIBBINS will dash my hopes (of becoming
    his "pup!" <i>Query</i>, isn't the word <i>infra
    dig.</i>&mdash;or merely "pleasantly colloquial?") to the
    ground.</p>

    <p>"I was," I say boldly, "going to ask you if you would let
    <i>me</i> read with you."</p>

    <p>"Were you?" replies DICK, apparently intensely astonished at
    the idea; "By Jove! I should be really sorry to disappoint
    <i>you</i>. Yes," he goes on in a burst of generosity, "I will
    make room for you&mdash;there!"</p>

    <p>This is really kind of DICK FIBBINS. We finally arrange that
    I am to come in two days' time&mdash;at the usual, and rather
    pretentious, fee of one hundred guineas for a year's
    "coaching"&mdash;and begin work.</p>

    <p>"You'll see some good cases with me&mdash;good fighting
    cases," FIBBINS remarks, as I take my leave. "When there are no
    briefs, why, you can read up the Law Reports, you know. My
    books are quite at your disposal."</p>

    <p>"But," I remark, a little surprised at that hint about no
    briefs&mdash;I thought DICK FIBBINS had more than he knew what
    to do with&mdash;"I suppose&mdash;er&mdash;there's plenty of
    business going on here?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, heaps," replies FIBBINS, hastily. Then, as if to do
    away with any bad impression which his thoughtless observation
    about no briefs might have occasioned in my mind, he says,
    heartily,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"And, when I take old PROSER up to the Court of Appeal,
    <i>you shall come too, and hear me argue!</i>"</p>

    <p>I express suitable gratitude&mdash;but isn't it rather
    "contempt of Court" on FIBBINS's part to talk about "taking up"
    a Judge?&mdash;and feel, as I depart, that I shall soon see
    something of the real inner life of the Profession.</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. What do you know about MARLOWE?</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. Isn't it somewhere near Taplow?</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. I think not, because Mr. IRVING went to unveil
    MARLOWE, and I don't think he is a rowing-man.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. But he may be doing it for Sir MORELL MACKENZIE,
    who has a place at Wargrave.</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Yes, but then the papers would have said
    something about it&mdash;wouldn't they?</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. Very likely; they would say anything in the silly
    season.</p>

    <h4>AFTER THE UNVEILING.</h4>

    <p><i>She</i>. Well, I know all about MARLOWE now. He was a
    great poet&mdash;greater than SHAKSPEARE, or thereabouts.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. Always thought that they would find some fellow
    greater than SHAKSPEARE. SHAKSPEARE always bores me awfully.
    But what did <i>this</i> fellow write?</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Oh, lots of things! <i>Faust</i>, amongst the
    rest.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. Come, that must be wrong, for <i>Faust</i> was

    come in?</p>

    <p><i>She</i>. Well, I am not quite sure.</p>

    <p><i>He</i>. You had better write to Mr. IRVING about it; he

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
